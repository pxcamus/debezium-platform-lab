This chart will install the components required to run the Debezium Platform.

1. Conductor: The back-end component which provides a set of APIs to orchestrate and control Debezium deployments.
2. Stage: The front-end component which provides a user interface to interact with the Conductor.
3. Debezium operator: operator that manages the creation of Debezium Server custom resource.
4. [Optional] PostgreSQL database used by conductor to store its data.
5. [Optional] Strimzi operator: operator for creating Kakfa cluster. In case you want to use a Kafka destination in you
   pipeline.

When monitoring is enabled, the chart also creates:
1. An `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource, which requires the OpenTelemetry Operator to already be installed.
2. [Optional] A `ServiceMonitor`, which requires the Prometheus Operator to already be installed.

More details in the [Monitoring](#monitoring) section. 

# Prerequisites

The chart use an ingress to expose `debezium-stage (UI)` and `debezium-conductor (backend)`,
this will require to have
an [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) installed in you
cluster.
You need also to have domain that must point to the cluster IP and then configure the `domain.name` property in
you `values.yaml` with your domain.

### Monitoring

The platform's built-in monitoring features require an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics from Debezium Server instances. 
The following operators must be installed in the cluster **before** deploying the chart with monitoring enabled (`monitoring.otel.enabled: true`):

1. **[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator)** — manages the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource that the chart creates.
   Install via Helm:
   ```shell
   helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
   helm install opentelemetry-operator open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator
   ```

2. **[Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)** (optional) — required only if you want the chart to create a `ServiceMonitor` for automatic Prometheus scraping (`monitoring.prometheus.serviceMonitor.enabled: true`). 
3. Commonly installed via the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) chart:
   ```shell
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
   ```

> **Note:** When monitoring is enabled you must set `monitoring.prometheus.url` to point to your Prometheus instance
> so that the conductor can query metrics. This is required regardless of how Prometheus was installed (operator, standalone, etc.).
> For example, if you installed `kube-prometheus-stack` in the `monitoring` namespace with default settings:
> ```yaml
> monitoring:
>   prometheus:
>     url: "http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090"
> ```

> **Note:** The OTel Collector must include the **Prometheus exporter**. The base `otelcol` distribution
> includes it, but when the OTel Operator is installed via Helm it defaults to the `otelcol-k8s` distribution
> which does **not**. If your operator uses the `k8s` distribution, set `monitoring.otel.collector.image`
> to override it with the base or contrib image, e.g.:
> - Base: `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector:0.152.0`
> - Contrib: `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.152.0`
>
> See [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) for available distributions and their included components.

## Descriptor OCI Artifacts

The conductor uses OCI artifacts containing component descriptors (JSON files) for connectors and transformations. This enables the platform to:
- Discover available connectors and transformations
- Render UI forms for configuration
- Validate pipeline configurations

### How it Works

At conductor startup, the OCI artifact is downloaded using **ORAS** (OCI Registry as Storage):
- Downloads the descriptor OCI artifact to local filesystem
- Extracts all descriptor JSON files
- Adds ~5-15 seconds to startup time
- Works on any Kubernetes version

### Configuration

The official Debezium descriptors are enabled by default:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: true
      registry: quay.io
      image: debezium/debezium-descriptors
      tag: nightly
      mountPath: /opt/descriptors
```

To use a specific version:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: true
      tag: 3.5.0  # Override just the tag
```

To disable descriptors:

```yaml
conductor:
  descriptors:
    official:
      enabled: false
```

### OCI Artifact Structure

Descriptor OCI artifacts should follow this structure:

```
debezium-descriptors:nightly
└── <version>/
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── source-connector/
    │   └── io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector.json
    └── transformation/
        └── io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState.json
```

The artifact contents are extracted to the configured `mountPath`.

## Extra Conductor Volumes

Additional volumes and volume mounts can be configured for the conductor container. This can be used, for example, to mount a ConfigMap containing a custom truststore.

```yaml
conductor:
  extraVolumes: 
    - name: truststore 
      configMap: 
        name: conductor-truststore
  extraVolumeMounts: 
    - name: truststore 
      mountPath: /etc/truststore 
      readOnly: true
```

## Debezium Server Image Configuration

By default, when pipelines are created, the Debezium Operator's `ServerImageProvider` automatically determines which Debezium Server image to use based on the configured version and connector type.

However, you can override this behavior and specify a custom Debezium Server image that will be used for all pipelines:

```yaml
server:
  image: quay.io/debezium/server:3.0.0.Final
```

### Use Cases

- **Pinning to a specific version**: Ensure all pipelines use a specific Debezium Server version
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: quay.io/debezium/server:3.0.0.Final
  ```

- **Using custom server image**: Deploy pipelines with a customized Debezium Server image
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: myregistry.io/custom-debezium-server:latest
  ```

- **Default behavior**: Leave empty to let the operator decide
  ```yaml
  server:
    image: ""  # Operator's ServerImageProvider determines the image
  ```

## Pipeline Labels

You can configure labels that will be applied to all DebeziumServer custom resources created by pipelines. These labels are merged with the internal `debezium.io/conductor-id` label that is always set automatically.

This is useful for integrating with tools like ArgoCD that rely on labels to track and group resources.

### Configuration

```yaml
pipeline:
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/instance: debezium-platform
    team: data-engineering
```

The labels are automatically converted to environment variables for the Conductor pod (e.g., `PIPELINE_LABELS_ARGOCD_ARGOPROJ_IO_INSTANCE`).

## Additional Monitoring Panels

The platform ships with built-in monitoring panels. You can add custom panels or override built-in ones by providing an additional panels file via a ConfigMap.

### Configuration

1. Create a ConfigMap with your custom panels:

```shell
kubectl create configmap custom-panels --from-file=panels.yml
```

Where `panels.yml` follows this format:

```yaml
panels:
  - id: my-custom-panel
    title: "Custom Metric"
    description: "My custom monitoring panel"

2. Mount it and set the path in your Helm values:

```yaml
conductor:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: custom-panels
      configMap:
        name: custom-panels
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: custom-panels
      mountPath: /opt/config/panels.yml
      subPath: panels.yml
      readOnly: true

monitoring:
  panels:
    additionalPanelsPath: /opt/config/panels.yml
```

Panels with matching `id` values override the built-in defaults. New `id` values are added alongside the built-in panels.
